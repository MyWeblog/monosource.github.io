# Radare2 Explorations Release

On the 10th of June, 2016, I've [officially](http://radare.today/posts/radare2-explorations/) released my humble contribution to the radare2 community, [radare2 Explorations](https://www.gitbook.com/book/monosource/radare2-explorations/details), a free, open-source, practical book which teaches you the basics of using radare2 in an easy-to-follow manner.

## Future plans

[R2CON 2016](http://rada.re/con/) is coming, the first edition of a con focused on radare2! I am hoping to see some innovative use of radare2 in binary exploitation and reverse engineering.

At some point in time, I will be working on a second book which will cover some more advanced and lesser known features of radare2.
